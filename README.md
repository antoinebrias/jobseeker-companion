## 🧑‍💻 How it Works

The extension reads the job description on the current page (e.g. LinkedIn job panel), tokenizes it, and compares it to the content of your CV. A similarity score is displayed, along with keywords covered and missing.

To install it manually:

1. Clone the repository
2. Go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
3. Click **"Load Temporary Add-on"**
